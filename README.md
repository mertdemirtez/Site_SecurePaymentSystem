⭐ This project was developed during a hackathon organized by ArkSigner, in collaboration with our YEMITech team. When my team members Ibrahim Bircan, Yaşar Issı, Mehmet Enes Aydın and I worked on this project, we were sophomore computer engineering students and we were able to complete this project in exactly 24 hours! ⭐

⭐ The personal information entered by the user is stored in our database in an encrypted form. As you can see, when there are multiple people in the frame, the system detects it and does not allow any action to be taken. When only one person remains in the frame, the system asks for the identification card to be presented and the person's photo to be taken, which is then scored. If the scoring stage is successfully passed, the captured photos are encrypted in Base64 format and the system proceeds to the security verification stage. Users who successfully pass this stage complete their transactions.⭐

⭐ You can also contribute to and support this project. Have a nice day, everyone! ⭐
